# Procedural BlockLandscape-GeneratorSystem Tool Prototype
by Antonio Wiege

Allows to setup a component that generates endless appearing, block based landscapes with configurable layers of noise grouped in lists as biomes.
Basic editing via brush and voxelized mesh stamps. Implementation of a shader in similar appearance to parallax occlusion mapping based on Catlike Coding tutorial 20.
More in the included README.txt & Handbook.fodt

Supported Platforms: Windows (10 & 11), Mac (Intel & M1)
Built-in renderpipeline; Originally 2022.2.11f1; Test with latest 2023 version show possible shader errors and crashes with open tool inspector on play mode.

Not a functioning tool. No save, load, export, etc.
An online copy of code to share privately. NOT free for use or open source, but good luck if you're learning this stuff.
Had a bit of a time crunch on this and given it's rapid prototyping nature the code may contain pestiferous gordian knots.
Perhaps I'll revisit this work and at least add the proper commentary and bug list. Structure and naming aren't ok either. This project needs a SOLID DRY KISS
